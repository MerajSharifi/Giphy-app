# Giphy search


For practicing JS and fetching API, I created a site where a user can search for any word. When searching a word the application will find a gif using the searched word using the giphy api: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/ 

Here is how it is going to work: 
The user can write some text indicating the gif he is looking for, click a button and then a gif will be found (using the searched word) and the gif will be displayed to the user.
